            <p class="address">Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
            <p> My interest to become a web/software developer comes from the growing dependance and implementation of
                 software solutions to real-world problems. Am awaiting to graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics
                  &amp; Computer Science from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.</p>

            <p>I have hands-on experience using SQL, Java, JavaScript and its frameworks like React JS , C/C++, PHP, and 
                Python languages to create and implement software applications.</p>

            <p>Using knowledge from some of these technologies, I have built several web and machine learning applications; one I would like to mention is the
                tour reservation application that integrates the MPESA-API for payments. The link to this project
                is https://github.com/onellvine/proxima_centauri/</p>

            <p>I have also worked as a frontend software engineer at Mambo Microsystems Inc., where I developed
                extensive user interfaces for websites and web applications. I managed to complete full websites
                written in PHP and Python frameworks while working on various personal projects. With these experiences, 
            I am confident I will be a worthy asset to your organization</p>

            <p>I look forward to a meeting where I can discuss my qualifications for this candidacy.</p>
            <p>Sincerely, Nellvine Oduor Ouma.</p>
